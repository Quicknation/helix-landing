### POST 1 — r/SideProject

**Title:**
I built a waitlist page for my AI platform in a weekend — trying to validate before I go all in

**Body:**
Hey r/SideProject,

Been using AI tools daily for the past year — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, you name it. They're all incredible on their own. But every time I switch between them, I lose context, repeat myself, and rebuild from scratch.

So I started building HELIX.

The idea: an AI platform where your tools actually work together. Two AI systems — one for production, one for experimentation — sharing context, feeding each other results, working as one.

Tagline is "Two worlds. One intelligence." Which I think captures it.

I'm at the validation stage right now. Before I invest serious time and money, I want to see if 50 people actually care enough to sign up.

**The page:** https://helix.hubnations.com

No payment. No spam. Just your email so I can update you as it develops.

Would love honest feedback:
- Does the problem resonate with you?
- What would make you actually sign up?
- What would you need to see in the product?

Building this in public. Will keep this community updated.

The first 50 sign-ups aren't just early access — they're **Beta Founders**. Free beta access until launch. No payment. All we ask: tell us what's working and what isn't. Your feedback shapes what gets built.

### POST 2 — r/ChatGPT (also works for r/artificial, r/ClaudeAI)

**Title:**
Why don't our AI tools talk to each other? I got tired of waiting for someone to fix it

**Body:**
Real talk — how many of you have a workflow that looks something like this:

- Use ChatGPT for research
- Paste results into Claude for coding
- Export something to another tool
- Lose context somewhere in between
- Repeat

We're in the most powerful era of AI ever built, and we're using these tools like isolated apps with no memory of each other.

I got tired of waiting for someone to fix it so I started building the fix.

It's called HELIX. The idea is simple: two AI systems (one for production-grade work, one for rapid experimentation) working together instead of in silos. One platform. One memory. One workflow.

I'm at the very beginning — validation phase. Trying to get 50 people on the waitlist before I invest more.

If this sounds like a problem you actually have: **https://helix.hubnations.com**

The first 50 sign-ups become **Beta Founders** — free beta access until launch in exchange for real feedback. No payment. Just tell us what works, what doesn't, and what you wish existed.

And genuinely curious — what's the biggest friction point in YOUR AI workflow right now? I'm building this based on real pain, not assumptions.

### POST 3 — r/entrepreneur (also works for r/startups)

**Title:**
Validating my AI startup idea the right way — 50 signups before I invest more. Here's the landing page

**Body:**
Running lean. Following the rules.

I'm building an AI platform called HELIX — the idea is that your AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, whatever you use) don't talk to each other. Every tool is isolated. Context gets lost. Productivity suffers.

HELIX is the layer that connects them. Two AI systems working as one. Built for people who do serious work with AI daily — developers, traders, creators, entrepreneurs.

Before I buy the full stack and go deep, I set a simple gate: **50 waitlist signups = proof of demand.**

The page is live: **https://helix.hubnations.com**

No pitch deck. No investor speak. The first 50 sign-ups are **Beta Founders** — free beta access until launch. No payment. In exchange: honest feedback on what's working. Your input shapes what HELIX becomes.

For the fellow founders in here — how do you validate before you build? What's your threshold for "this is worth pursuing"?

## TWITTER / X THREAD

**Post these as a thread — Tweet 1 → 2 → 3... in one connected thread.**

---

**Tweet 1 — THE HOOK**
Something's been missing from the AI space for a while.

I'm building the fix.

A thread 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 — THE PROBLEM**
You probably use 3–5 AI tools every day.

Claude for coding.
ChatGPT for research.
Gemini for docs.
Maybe Midjourney. Maybe Perplexity.

They're all incredible.

But they don't talk to each other.

Every time you switch — you lose context. You repeat yourself. You rebuild from scratch.

---

**Tweet 3 — THE REALITY**
We're living in the most powerful era of AI tools ever built.

And we're using them like isolated apps on a 2010 smartphone.

No integration. No memory. No flow.

You do the connecting manually. Every. Single. Time.

---

**Tweet 4 — THE SOLUTION**
I'm building HELIX.

An AI platform where your tools work as one.

Two systems. Two strengths. One intelligence.

→ One side handles production-grade work
→ The other handles rapid experimentation
→ Both share context. Both feed each other results.

---

**Tweet 5 — WHO IT'S FOR**
HELIX is built for people who use AI to do serious work.

Developers. Traders. Creators. Entrepreneurs.

People who live in AI tools all day and feel the friction every time they switch.

If that's you — this is for you.

---

**Tweet 6 — THE CALL TO ACTION**
The first 50 are Beta Founders.

Free beta access until launch.
No payment. No commitment.

All we ask: tell us what's working and what's not.
Your feedback shapes HELIX before it ships to the world.

**Tweet 7 — OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP (post 24hrs later)**
24 hours in.

[X] Beta Founders have claimed their spot.

[50 - X] spots left.

Building in public. Every milestone, every lesson — I'll share it here.
